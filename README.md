## Contents

The back feet mount with a screw through them:

*   `underwood_foot_back.scad`: OpenSCAD source file for the back feet.
*   `underwood_foot_back.stl`: Exported STL file for the back feet.

The front feet have a press-fit peg that goes into a circular bracket on the underside of the typewriter:

*   `underwood_foot_front.scad`: OpenSCAD source file for the front feet.
*   `underwood_foot_front.stl`: Exported STL file for the front feet.

## Usage

Print the `.stl` files using some form of medium density TPU. I used 95A.

## Future suggestions

The feet would be nicer if the edges were a little rounded.
